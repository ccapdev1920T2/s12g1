This project creates a database of restaurants wherein users can look up the restaurants, view their menus, write reviews, and more. In addition to that, users are able to collect posts by getting upvotes from their reviews that are given by other users.   

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open two terminals inside the project
    * One inside /view
    * One inside /server

##### For Server side
1. Install the packages (`npm i`)
2. Type `npm run backend`
3. Open http://localhost:9090/populate

**By this part, database should already been populated**

##### For View side
1. Install the packages (`npm i`)
2. Type `npm run serve`
3. Open http://localhost:3000 

**Remember to keep both terminals opened**

### Test Cases
#### Test Case 1 (Unlogged User)
1. Once you open the app at http://localhost:3000 , you will be greeted with the landing page.

2. From here you can scroll down to see the section with the title of “Collections” which is also considered as the featured restaurants’ section. The restaurants in this section differ every time the user navigates back to this page.  Feel free to choose from one of the three restaurants by clicking the “view restaurant” button under the desired restaurant.

4. Here you can access the Photos (Photos of the restaurant establishment), Menu (Photos of restaurant menu), and Reviews (which contains the reviews of that specified restaurant). These can be accessed at the top right section of the screen just below the navbar.

5. As an unlogged user, you do not have access to saving the restaurant to your dining history or writing reviews for any restaurant. 

6. When you are at the Menu or Photos section of the restaurant page, the lower-left half of the screen will be a carousel of images. Each image can be clicked to be enlarged and shown in a modal.

7. While in the modal, you can navigate through the pictures of that section by using the left and right arrow buttons beside the current image. If you wish to exit, you may press the close button present at the top section of the modal.
